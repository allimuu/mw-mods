## More Interesting Combat (WIP)

A mod to make combat, well, more interesting! It aims to give each weapon type a unique flavour and bonus effects. Each weapon now has unique bonus effects at each weapon skill level tier (25, 50, 75 and 100 respectively).

**Progress**

- [x] Short blade
- [x] Long blade

**Short blade** 

Short blade is all about fast and deadly attacks, so short blades can now critical strike and expose weakness of the enemy!
A Critical strike is bonus 50% damage with increased chance to crit at higher tiers.
As well as starting at weapon skill 50, debuffs the enemy with Expose Weakness that increases weapon damage until combat ends.

**Long blade**

Long blade is all about precision and skill, so long blades now have multistrike!
Multistrike allows long blades to do bonus damage on each third hit, with the chance starting at weapon skill 50 or higher, to do douoble damage on the third hit.

**Blunt weapon**

Blunt weapon is all about brute force, so blunt weapons can now stun and break armor!
Stun is a 1 second paralyze with higher chance at higher tiers. And starting at weapon skill 50 or higher, increasing disintegrate armor on hit. 

**Axe**

Axe is all about slashing through the enemies protection, so axe can now bleed!
Axe has an increasing chance to bleed at higher tiers, and starting at weapon skill 50 or higher, increased the number of bleed stacks up to 4 maximum stacks of bleed.
Bleed is bonus 25% damage over 5 seconds, stacking up to 100% damage over 5 seconds.

**Spear**

Spear is all about using superior range and position to your advantage, so spear has higher damage the lower the encumberence of the enemy relative to their total. An starting at weapon skill 50 or higher, has a chance to hamstring the enemy which is a 200 pts burden for 3 seconds.
