Black Hands Dagger

Cast When Strikes
Absorb Health 10-25 pts for 30 secs on Touch  -> Absorb Health 5-10 pts for 15 secs on Touch
Blind 10-50% for 30 secs on Touch             -> Blind 30-40% for 15 secs on Touch

Reasoning:
Black Hands Dagger is one of the most powerful DPS weapons in the game and with such a powerful Absorb Health also one of the easiest for defense. So the Absorb Health was reduced by half in magnitude and duration (and it's still one of the highest DPS weapons) and the Blind effect range was brought in to make it more reliable. It's still very strong even with the nerfs.

Soul Drinker

Cast When Strikes
Soultrap for 30 secs on Touch
NEW: Absorb Health 1-5 pts on Touch

Reasoning:
Generaly a good dagger but not much use for any pure mage. Adding Absorb Health increases it's damage and defensive capability.

Shimsil

Cast When Used				 ->  Constant Effect
Fortify Sneak 5 pts for 30 secs on Self  ->  Fortify Sneak 5pts
Chameleon 10-30 pts for 30 secs on Self  ->  Chameleon 10pts

Fury

Constant Effect
REMOVED: Blind Blind 20% on Self
NEW: Drain Endurance 10 pts on Self
Drain Heavy Armor 20 pts on Self  -> 10pts on Self
Drain Medium Armor 20 pts on Self -> 10pts on Self
Drain Light Armor 20 pts on Self  -> 10pts on Self
Drain Unarmored 20 pts on Self    -> 10pts on Self
Fortify Attack 20 pts on Self

Reasoning:
This was always a weird one. Removed the Blind and reduced the drain on skills, but also added drain endurance (which will hurt a bit if you use state-based HP) but now it's a good source of Fortify Attack.

Magebane

Cast When Used				    ->  Constant Effect
Resist Magicka 20-40% for 10 secs on Self   ->  Resist Magicka 15%

Stormkiss

Cast When Used                   -> Cast When Strikes
Shock Damage 1-25 pts on Target  -> Shock Damage 5-15 pts on Target

Reasoning:
Cast when used on a melee weapon? Seriously? Not as strong as the Cloudcleaver and overall less DPS but much better now.

Bonebiter Bow of Sul-Senipul

Cast When Used                   -> Constant Effect
Damage Agility 20 pts on Target  -> Fortify Attack 7pts on Self

Reasoning:
Using Damage Agility before shooting out of sneak doesn't make any sense, also in the general spirit of removing cast when used, now it has Fortify Attack which will be very strong early game.

Shortbow of Sanguine Sureflight

Cast When Used                             -> Constant Effect
Fortify Marksman 7 pts for 30 secs on Self -> Fortify Marksman 5pts
