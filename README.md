# Next Generation Combat

Brings Morrowind combat into the next generation! 

**Features**

* 100% chance to hit
* All attributes and skills in the game are still useful with 100% hit! (See below)
* Complete compatibility - no patches needed for weapoon, race, NPC mods, anything.
* Unique and interesting weapon perks to make combat more interesting! (See below)
* Works with ranged weapons.
* Everything works for all NPCs and creatures the same, creating a uniform and balanced combat experience.

## Attributes and skills

* __Weapon skill__ along with the weapon perks every 25 levels (see below), will now give a small damage boost equivalent to 20% extra damage at 100 (0.2% per level). (This affects NPCs/creatures too)
* __Fortify Attack__ will now give a flat damage bonus, 1pt is 0.5% more damage. Making Fortify Attack still very valuable! This will affect NPCs/creatures too, so combat will feel a little faster overall.
* __Sanctuary__ now reduces the damage taken by 1-3% per 10 pts of Sanctuary, making 100 pts of Sanctuary a 10-30% damage reduction. The more Agility you have the more effect Sanctuary will have.
* __Blind__ will still reduce chance to hit, so you can still miss due to being blinded. But this is far more understandable, if you are blinded, missing at point blank makes more sense. Miss rate at 1% per pt like vanilla, 30 pt Blind will cause someone to have a 30% chance to miss.
